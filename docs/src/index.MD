ImplicitGlobalGrid renders the distributed parallelization of stencil-based GPU and CPU applications on a regular staggered grid almost trivial and enables close to ideal weak scaling of real-world applications on thousands of GPUs \[[1][JuliaCon19], [2][PASC19], [3][JuliaCon20a]\]:

ImplicitGlobalGrid relies on the Julia MPI wrapper ([MPI.jl]) to perform halo updates close to hardware limit and leverages CUDA-aware or ROCm-aware MPI for GPU-applications. The communication can straightforwardly be hidden behind computation \[[1][JuliaCon19], [3][JuliaCon20a]\] (how this can be done automatically when using ParallelStencil.jl is shown in \[[3][JuliaCon20a]\]; a general approach particularly suited for CUDA C applications is explained in \[[4][GTC19]\]).

A particularity of ImplicitGlobalGrid is the automatic *implicit creation of the global computational grid* based on the number of processes the application is run with (and based on the process topology, which can be explicitly chosen by the user or automatically defined). As a consequence, the user only needs to write a code to solve his problem on one GPU/CPU (*local grid*); then, **as little as three functions can be enough to transform a single GPU/CPU application into a massively scaling Multi-GPU/CPU application**. See the [example](#multi-gpu-with-three-functions) below. 1-D, 2-D and 3-D grids are supported. Here is a sketch of the global grid that results from running a 2-D solver with 4 processes (P1-P4) (a 2x2 process topology is created by default in this case):

## Dependencies
ImplicitGlobalGrid relies on the Julia MPI wrapper ([MPI.jl]), the Julia CUDA package ([CUDA.jl] \[[5][Julia CUDA paper 1], [6][Julia CUDA paper 2]\]) and the Julia AMDGPU package ([AMDGPU.jl]).
